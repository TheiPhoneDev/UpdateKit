#  UpdateKit

## Requirements
**UpdateKit** requires iOS 15.0, macOS 12.0 and visionOS 1.0

## What is update kit ?

**UpdateKit** is a simple and lightweight Swift library that simplifies update screens. As a developer I find myself to have to write release notes, and sometime I don't show it in the best way possible to the our users. One-time update screen are the best way to show our users the new version's changes and let them know what's new and what's been fixed.

## UpdateKit structure
**UpdateKit** is inspired to Apple update screens, which can be seen in iOS built-in apps. I wanted to create a simple structure that is flexible and also customizable and can be suited to the developer's needs.

## Usage
To use UpdateKit, first of all:
- Import UpdateKit in your project. You can implement it as SPM (Swift Package Manager)
- Go to the UpdateNotes.swift file and edit the updateNotes collection. That's where the release notes are collected.
- Call the UpdateViewHandler view wherever you need it.
